# Chapter 33: Metadyskolia
**Date Point: October, 10y10m2w3d AV**
**Crzlrfek System, The Freedom Stars**

***Warhorse***

...

...

...Taste of blood. Texture of pain. World gone gray.

Alive.

Warhorse always wore one of the maximum doses of Crue-D in the same place, ready to grab on muscle memory. There was nothing coherent going on between his ears but his hand did its thing anyway. The needle-prick in the flesh of his side was completely lost under the agony ringing through his limbs, but somehow just the act of injecting himself was enough to restore something like functionality to his fried neurons.

*Vengeance.*

Highland was moving too, slowly. He was winded and stunned from his collision with the wall from where Warhorse had thrown him clear across the room, and pawed groggily for his rifle as the Hunter swaggered into the room. One of the big ones, the Red Hunters. Skinless studies in warped musculature that had raped themselves with metal.

It thought it was in no danger.

Warhorse wasn’t quite running on instinct and wasn’t quite thinking fully either. He was somewhere in limbo between the bloody howling rage of an ape and the dispassionate judicial arbitration of a judge. It didn’t matter either way: he had no weapon in his hands, but right now he neither needed nor wanted one.

He charged.

He grabbed.

He *squeezed.*

He ***enjoyed.***

Every little pop. Every little gasp and struggle. Every grinding crunch. The slippery *squish*. The creak, snap and stretch. The twitching, the spasms, the gurgle… The kill.

He let go of the hunter’s body and lifted its torn-off head so that he could stare it in some of its glassy dead eyes. "...’s what you fuckin’ get for… messin’ with..."

Fuck it. Fuck words. He slammed the head flat-palmed into the nearest wall, crushing it almost flat in the process and covering the wall and himself in exploded gore. He grunted, braced himself against the deck, pushed forward with his full strength and ground his palm into the mess, until the wall and floor were dented beyond repair and the skull was no more. Something deep inside him approved and drew an apelike rictus grin across his face. He snorted in contempt, left the sticky bits of bone and brain to slide down… and the tide of adrenaline rolled back to leave him stranded high and dry on cold dark sands.

He dreamed of gunfire, and somebody calling *"Man down!"*

Letter for notes,

RE: Miss Ava Magdalena **Ríos**

This troubled young lady, who has special access to DEEP RELIC and was involved in Operation EMPTY BELL, returned to my clinic today for her third session. She is struggling with PTSD and suicidal ideations.

Today she was well-groomed and appropriately presented. Her mood today was objectively low but she made good eye contact and states that subjectively today was a "good day".

Overall she is still feeling generally low and she states that she still has suicidal thoughts. Her flashbacks have not improved but she felt able to describe them in more detail today.

Her flashbacks are clearly vivid and realistic, and entail "clear visions" of blood, death and personal peril sometimes including smell and taste. One detail she described as being particularly disturbing was that she can "taste Vinther’s blood on the air". Master Sergeant Roy Vinther was KIA during Operation EMPTY BELL, and she went into morbid detail today about the exact manner of his death. She continues to have difficulty sleeping and reports that she often has vivid dreams that wake her up.

She expressed concern today that she is prone to risk-taking and spontaneous behaviour, though she denies any criminality or drug use. When asked what form her risk-taking behaviour takes, she talked at length about her romantic history. She describes that she was unfaithful to her long term partner of several years and expressed remorse for this. She denies being sexually promiscuous, and states that she has only had two sexual partners. She says she is "not ready" to seek a new partner yet. I do not agree that she takes inappropriate risks or engages in self-destructive behaviour, and I suspect she is simply guilty and confused.

She told me that she has asked her best friend to supervise her as she takes her medicine. When asked why, she explained that she "hates" taking the medicine because it *"Forces me to think about stuff I don’t want to think about."*

Considering her suicidal thoughts, I agree that it is probably sensible for her not to have immediate access to her medicine.

I have reassured her that her Paroxetine will improve matters, and she understands that she should not expect immediate results. Considering the severity and realism of her flashbacks I have raised the possibility of animal therapy, for which she expressed considerable enthusiasm. She says that she "really would like" a therapy dog, and I will see whether we can start the process of applying for one.

I will see her again in two weeks or on an emergency basis.

**Date Point 10y10m2w4d AV**
**Command Station 1053** ***’Linchpin Of Infinity’,*** **Orbiting Planet Vetrin, The Orin Line**

***Fleetmaster Garal***

"What class of ship is that?"

"They call it a '*destroyer’."*

Garal forced herself not to shudder. In the Loc’ language, the word for "destroyer" was a guttural, terse thing that neatly conveyed the brutality of the concept. It was somehow fitting that deathworlders would designate a ship class that way.

It *looked* like a force of destruction, too, to a degree that offended her sense of aesthetics. This was not a ship built to look glorious: it wasn’t a flying monument to pride and wealth. It was a shovel-nosed black lump with a shuttle riding piggyback on the flat expanse of its back, next to a tower structure that was most likely its bridge.

And it was small. Against the scale of dock designed to accommodate war platforms, the *destroyer* had elbow room aplenty.

Her second-in-command was a Vgork shipmaster by the name of Selag who, like Garal, had been forced into the echelons of higher command by sudden vacancies. The loss of his left arm during an Alliance raid hadn’t made a good case for his remaining in the field either. He was experienced, and she needed that experience.

"Suddenly, I am very glad they are on our side…" he mused.

Garal made a nonverbal noise conveying misgivings. "You do *know* the name of this particular destroyer, do you not?" she asked.

"No…?"

"It is called *Violent*."

Selag made a rumbling noise deep in his chest that Garal’s translator implant flagged as an expression of feeling off-balance. "Violent, Destroyer… Are they bloodthirsty, or just unsubtle?"

Garal didn’t comment.

"I’ll receive them in my office," she declared, and turned away from the window.

"As you command, Fleetmaster."

**Date Point: October 10y10m2w4d AV**
**HMS** ***Valiant,*** **Orbiting Planet Vetrin, The Orin Line**

***Colour Sergeant Robert Murray***

"Hello sergeant. How are you feeling?"

Murray shrugged noncommittally. "Bloody thrashed, but alive," he said. "...How is he?"

*Valiant’s* chief medical officer, Doctor Moorman, glanced at his infirmary’s only patient who was rather too large for his bed. "Sedated, but conscious. One of the awkward side-effects of Crue-D, while you chaps are on it you’re all but impossible to put under… though considering that we’d have lost him without it, I can live with that."

"Can I have a wee word with him?"

"Of course."

‘Horse on meds was almost guaranteed to be amusing. He aimed a big thumbs up and his largest, most goofiest smile as Murray joined him. "Heyyy, bro."

"You are an absolute fuckin’ madman, you know that?" Murray said affectionately and sat down. They locked hands in a brothers’ handshake. "And I’d be dead if not for you, so…thanks."

‘Horse grinned and waved it off in the happy, high way of a man who was dosed up to the gills. "‘S what I’m for."

"Is that right? Throwing me right across the bloody room is what you’re for is it?" Murray chuckled. "We should use that move in gravball sometime."

"Yer talkative…" ‘Horse observed, and laughed. "Wha’ve you done with the real Murray?"

Murray laughed with him, but after a few seconds they sobered.

"...Am I in trouble?" ‘Horse asked.

"Nah pal. No. But I had a merry bloody time of it in Hotwash going over our helmet cam footage. D’you remember what you did?"

"Yyyup. The whole thing. The explosion, my patient getting killed, the grenade… ‘s weird, I always thought after Nervejam stuff was supposed to go fuzzy… You, uh… you saw what happened next?"

"Mmm. I saw." Murray’s fitful dreams that night had revolved restlessly around the expression he’d seen on his young comrade’s face, even through the visor, as he’d got the Hunter in a *sleeper hold* of all things before screwing its head off as slowly as he could.

‘Horse had the decency to look uncomfortable, and he seemed to be sobering quickly. Moorman was right about Crue-D versus sedatives. "I… shit, man."

Murray did his best to put an arm round the younger man’s shoulders, and made it slightly more than halfway. "I been at this even longer than Stainless," he said. "And... Ye’re not alone. Okay? Every poor bastard who stays in this business long enough comes up against their dark side one day."

"...You always seem so calm."

"Mm-hmm. Ice in my veins. Scares the shite right out of me."

‘Horse hung his head and sighed. "...I shouldn’ta enjoyed it," he said. "That’s *their* thing. I don’t wanna be like them."

"You’ll never be like them, you giant fuckin’ womble stomper!" Murray told him, and was rewarded when the unconventional insult raised a small amused snort. "You feel bad about it! *They* never will."

"Makes me wonder, though…"

"Of course it does. But we do what we do so other people don’t have to, mate, and we look out for each other. I canny throw you across a fuckin’ room, but… *Ack!"*

Adam could hug hard enough to crush oil drums, but he *usually* never forgot it. This time was an exception and Murray felt his joints creak before Adam remembered himself and eased off a bit.

"...Sarry."

"‘S’okay…" Murray had learned the hard way that when Adam wanted Hug, Adam *got* Hug, and there was no way out except patience.

Or the intervention of a higher authority in the form of a nurse. She knocked on the door to get their attention and gave Murray a not unkind look that asked him to leave. "My patient needs to rest, Colour Sergeant."

"Like fuck, I feel *fine*!" Adam objected.

The nurse was having none of it. "Standing orders for nervejam trauma is that you remain under observation until you’ve had an MRI."

"How the fuck am *I* gonna fit in an MRI machine?"

The nurse just shrugged in a ‘not-my-problem’ way.

Adam sighed and let go, and Murray stood up. "Here and now ye’re alive, pal," he reminded him. "Plenty of time to talk about it later."

"...Right."

"If it’s any consolation, I’m stuck here too. Crying shame."

"Yeah? Why?"

"Because I *really* wanted to see the Fleetmaster’s face when Stainless delivers the good news..."

**Date Point: October 10y10m2w4d AV**
**Command Station 1053** ***’Linchpin Of Infinity’,*** **Orbiting Planet Vetrin, The Orin Line**

***Fleetmaster Garal***

Garal didn’t need to be alerted that there were deathworlders outside her office. They shook the deck just by walking, heavy, purposeful and strong.

She pre-empted the inevitable request and called her aide. "Send them through, please."

"Um… that, is, uh, Fleetmaster, they-"

"Now, please."

"...Yes. Yes, Fleetmaster."

The door opened, and four humans walked in.

She’d never seen a human in person before, but they were at least pleasantly easy to tell apart. Their facial features varied quite markedly, their skin tones ran a wide gamut, and between those factors plus variations in the hues of their eyes and hair she-

A severed head landed on her desk, shattering her train of thought.

It belonged to a Celzi, and Celzi were much harder to tell apart than humans. If not for the weak flicker of a dying translation implant that was still trying to tell the world who its owner was, she never would have recognized Warmaster Trez Ekrat.

Very, very slowly she reeled in her stunned thoughts and managed to get them into something resembling order. They came unstuck again when two more humans, both much larger than their fellows, squeezed through the door carrying what was obviously the main databank from a facility-sized computer installation, rack, power supply and all.

Its metal feet squealed offensively on the floor of her office as they put it down and pushed it into the corner.

And then they just stood there. Waiting.

Garal took her time to ensure that she was properly balanced and calm before she tried to react. She moistened her mouth and, quite delicately, pushed her chair back from the desk and the grisly trophy upon it.

"...What is this?" she asked.

"The man himself didn’t survive being collected," the human in front said. He had a deep voice that was more growl than speech and the translator clipped to his chest absolutely suffused the voice it created for him with menace and short patience. There was something badly unnerving about those cold, bright blue eyes that had locked onto her and were watching patiently for her to… twitch. Run away. Make a mistake. Whatever they were waiting for wouldn’t be good for Garal. "But his implants should still have some useful data."

"This is not… *quite* what I had in mind."

"No? Well that’s too bad." The one who was apparently the leader stepped back from her desk and tucked his thumbs into his belt. The easy and relaxed poise of the stance was precisely the opposite of reassuring: it said *’there is nothing here that I could not destroy.’*

He looked to one of the larger men beside him. "Rebar."

The ridiculous anachronism of a paper hard-copy folder slapped down on Garal’s desk. She picked it up and opened it. The humans had at least been courteous enough to include the information-dense machine code that translator implants used as a textual go-between. It allowed her to assimilate all of the information on the page instantly.

The report was succinct, technical, efficient and impossible. A chain of orbital defense satellites destroyed, a ground installation smashed, a Hunter Broodship destroyed, several thousand Hunters killed. High-Value Target neutralized, intelligence recovered and critical infrastructure destroyed. The Crzlrfek system completely neutralized as an Alliance base of operations.

Cost: Two humans *wounded*.

There was an itemized bill detailing the number and value of all the resources expended right down to the gram of deuterium reactor fuel.

Garal tried to reclaim some authority by standing up, founded on the fact that she was bigger than even the biggest of these deathworlders. Yes, they all could have torn her arms off, but sheer size surely had to count for *something*. The correlation between size and dominance was a near-universal in xenopsychology.

"How?" She demanded.

The human’s scouring gaze didn’t waver. "Classified."

"Whatever you did, if the Dominion learned your-"

"No."

"It would save lives."

The human snorted and reached out to flick one of the head’s ears with his finger and what Garal took as a distasteful expression. "Whose? His? Poor fooker was just doing his job, just like us. No, Fleetmaster. Our methods are classified and even if I was inclined to consider sharing them, which I’m not, I don’t have the authority."

"...I see. But was it truly necessary to drop… this… on my desk?"

"It was, yes."

"Why?" Garal felt like she was being yanked through the conversation.

The human smiled slightly. It went a finger’s width up only one side of his mouth without touching his eyes at all, and was *not* a friendly or happy gesture. "In my culture we have a warning, Fleetmaster," he said. "It goes *’be careful what you wish for; you might get it.'"*

"I don’t remember asking for a *severed head* on my… What is your name, anyway?" Garal finally managed to haul herself back into what she hoped was control of the conversation.

"Stainless. And his head was always going to be somewhere, Fleetmaster. That’s the bloody *point* of sendin’ us to kill him, he ends up dead. We thought it might be worth remindin’ you of that. Good day."

Garal sputtered as they turned and left her office, an oozing body part and a one-tonne rack of computer equipment at the end of a trench of wrecked flooring. "What? No, you can’t just-!"

"We expect full remuneration of our net expenses within thirty days. Good day."

"No, wait!" Garal stormed to the door and pointed at her aide. "You: Stop them."

"Uh…" the poor Vzk’tk thus addressed watched the humans thump purposefully out the door. "...I beg your pardon fleetmaster but…how?"

The door closed behind them, and Garal ran two of her hands over her scalp while the other two planted themselves on her hips - a gesture of being totally at a loss.

"...Contact battlefield forensics and have them send up a team to my office. And, find me another office to work from until mine has been sanitized and repaired."

"Of course, Fleetmaster."

"And if I try to ask humans for help ever again, I want you to talk me out of it."

The Vzk’tk blinked. "...How, Fleetmaster?"

Garal spun back into her office. "Remind me what happened *this* time," she snapped.

**Date Point: November 10y11m1w AV**
**BGEV-11** ***’Misfit’,*** **Interstellar deep space, near the Border Stars**

***Allison Buehler***

Deep space travel had its own slow rhythm, and adjusting to that rhythm after months of constant scheduled activity was a challenge. They all knew how, of course, they’d all been there before… but once the daily work routine was out of the way, the ship cleaned and maintained, the laundry done, their meals prepared, their bodies exercised and their chores complete then the only two ways left to pass the time were education and entertainment, and they all *hated* the education side of it.

All three of them were hands-on, learn-by-doing types and Allison had surprised herself with how well she had picked up the academic component of *Misfit’s* needs. The desperate determination to not fail Julian and Xiù had driven her to achieve things that her high school teachers would never have imagined, and she’d done it all for *them*.

But now she had to learn their jobs, and they had to learn hers. They just couldn’t *afford* to be exclusively specialized because no matter what their personal feelings on the matter were, the Group had made it clear that *’just in case’* anything happened to one of them, the others would be able to get home.

Which meant that whether they liked it or not, they’d learned each others’ jobs to a basic standard. Julian and Allison could fly the ship, Xiù and Julian could handle simple maintenance and the flight power balancing, and Allison and Xiù could both work the sensors, telescopes and drones.

They all had the basics down, they’d never have taken off otherwise. But their in-flight training time was supposed to be about digging into the academic minutiae of other's’ jobs, and all three of them were struggling, and were thus feeling frustrated and incompetent.

They *weren’t*, demonstrably so. But the more they studied the more clear it became that they really had been well-assigned. Julian and Xiù seemed convinced that *Misfit’s* engineering was more fragile and hazardous than was really the case, neither Xiù nor Allison had the temperament for memorizing hundreds of different kinds of rock and how to identify them from orbit, and Allison and Julian were both far too heavy-handed for *Misfit’s* spirited controls.

They were also forcing themselves into working shifts, and that was coming with all sorts of problems because they’d grown used to sleeping in one warm snuggle. The pattern of two awake and one asleep just didn’t work for them at all, because the sleeper invariably complained of feeling alone or cold. None of them were sleeping well, except when they caved to temptation and cuddled up for an unprofessional triple nap.

Difficulty, frustration, restless sleep and a dash of guilt were a potent blend for irritability, and that meant little fights.

Never anything major. Never. Things were always a calming word or a hug away from being completely soothed over and forgiven. Indeed, theirs was overall a happy ship… but not perfectly so.

Perhaps the weirdest sticking point was between Julian and Xiù though, and they managed to wake Allison up over it.

She was jolted awake by the sound of Xiù demanding "But *why not?* It’s fun!"

"I know, just…" Julian made an exasperated noise. "I don’t want to."

Xiù didn’t look happy at all, so he closed the dishwasher and hugged her. "I’m sorry *bǎobèi*, I know I’m being dumb, but it just makes me uncomfortable."

"Fine…"

Allison glanced at the clock. She’d been asleep for five hours, and she decided that was enough. She hauled herself out of her bunk with a sigh. "You two okay?"

Xiù gave her a good morning kiss and got her breakfast out of the fridge to reheat in the oven. "It’s nothing important."

Julian did the same and poured her an orange juice. "I’m just being cautious."

Allison accepted the juice and drained half of it in one slug. "About what?"

"I said *’yes sir’* and it made him uncomfortable," Xiù explained.

Allison gave Julian a quizzical look. He had a mild sub streak, which meant that he’d always enjoyed being bossed around by the two of them and never quite seemed happier than when he got the chance to say *’yes ma’am’* and be praised with the words *’good boy’*. It was a harmless game, but now she thought about she and him had never reversed their roles.

"Why?" she asked.

He shrugged helplessly. "I dunno. Maybe I… I dunno."

"Spit it out, dummy."

He sighed. "I guess… maybe I’m more comfortable having my boundaries pushed than I am with pushing yours," he said, gesturing to both of them.

"Even if I want them pushed?" Xiù asked.

"Yeah, but.. How far?"

Xiù didn’t seem to have an answer to that one. She frowned thoughtfully and turned her attention back to the oven.

"Baby, the whole point of pushing boundaries is you don’t know how far you want them pushed," Allison pointed out.

"Well, this is one of my boundaries too and **I** don’t want it pushed," he said, firmly. "I’m sorry."

Allison’s hand landed on Xiù’s elbow just in time to pre-empt the word *’but’*, and she shut the question down with a slight headshake. Xiù hesitated, then nodded and she and Julian kissed and made up, to Allison’s relief.

"I’m… gonna go check the exoplanet scan," he declared lamely, and let himself out.

Left alone, the girls exchanged awkward shrugs, and Allison used the bathroom and the shower then ate her breakfast with her hair still damp. She had to admit, the shorter cut was *far* more convenient than wrapping it up in a towel. She pretty much just had to scrub it and leave it.

Xiù sat down opposite her. "Is he mad at me?"

"No! No." Allison put down her fork. "What gave you that idea?"

"He just seemed really uncomfortable."

"He was, yeah."

"I didn’t mean to…"

"It’s *okay*, dummy." Allison smiled for her. "He knows you didn’t."

"I just… don’t understand why."

Allison nodded and picked the fork back up. "...You know, I had to deal with some real assholes back in Boston," she said. "Before I was taken. Guys who wanted to park me on the back of their bike. Like, I woulda been property to them, you know?"

Xiù nodded and listened.

"They were *so* fucking insecure. They’d get into fights over fucking nothing because their precious little princess egos couldn’t handle the least little disrespect… like, say, turning them down when they made a pass," Allison scoffed. "...and they never wanted the *’little girl’* fixing their bike either. And trust me, having a guy like that angry at you is… it’s scary. That’s why I started carrying."

*"Āi ya…"*

"Yeah… Well, Julian’s confident and calm, and that makes him more of a man than any of those shitkickers. He doesn’t *need* to be the boss dog. And… You know how he sees himself in this, right?" she asked, spiralling the fork to indicate the three of them.

"How?"

"He’s here for *us*. I think he’d be perfectly content in his grampa’s house trapping beaver and shooting geese all year for his whole life… But what he really wants is to make you and me happy."

"Yeah, but...." Xiù’s signature blush was a rarer sight nowadays but it came back strong. "...I mean, in this case…"

"You want him to call you a *’good girl’* ‘cause that’d make you happy?" Allison teased. "Kinky. Do you want him to spank you too?"

*"Allison-!"* Xiù was now crimson with fierce embarrassment.

Allison laughed and waved a hand in an apologetic gesture that was anything but apologetic. "Well, you’ve told him. Maybe he’ll come around, maybe not. There’s some things you can’t force. See, the whole *’yes ma’am’* thing just… happened. Naturally. We didn’t sit down and plan it, I never asked him to say that, that’s just how things played out. I like it, and… I guess I’d feel weird saying *’yes sir’* to him."

"So I should wait and see, and be prepared for in case he doesn’t ever want to play that game with me," Xiù summarized.

"Pretty much. Sorry, baby. But hey, at least you can yes-ma’am me, right?"

"Yeah but… um…" The blush had begun to fade, but it rallied magnificently. "...It’d be even hotter with him. Sorry."

"I can handle *’even’* hotter…" Allison gave her a witchy grin. "Just so long as it’s a *little* hot with me."

"...It’s hot," Xiù confessed.

"Good girl."

Flustered, Xiù cleared her throat and bustled to tidy up an already-tidy kitchen, and Allison ate her breakfast with a victorious smile. She was scraping the last of it off her plate when Julian returned looking pleased.

"Good news?" Allison asked him.

"Got a strong contact. Nitrogen, oxygen and water, right kind of star, right kind of orbit… It’s a bit out of our way, over toward the Near Three Kiloparsec Arm about a week away, but it looks good!"

"A temperate world!" Xiù grinned.

"Probably. *Misfit* gives it sixty percent."

"Man, *Creature of Habit* went its entire mission without seeing one," Allison recalled happily.

"Our telescope’s better. *Much* better."

"It’s the BEST," Xiù joked, and beamed when Julian and Allison both groaned.

The Brahe Exoplanet Survey Telescope lived up to its acronym and then some by relying on enormous force-field lenses rather than glass ones or a parabolic mirror. It was so incredibly sensitive that although it couldn’t actually produce an image of planets orbiting a distant star, it could certainly detect that some light was being reflected *by* those planets and even hazard an informed guess at their atmospheric composition… and it could do so a few hundred times a second.

It also looked nothing like a telescope. It was a flat panel about the size of a thin mattress that recessed neatly into *Misfit’s* dorsal hull when it wasn’t in use.

"She’s adorable, isn’t she? Just wanna… bundle her up and lock her in the store room sometimes." Allison snorted. Xiù stuck her tongue out at her.

Julian laughed. "I thought maybe we should go check it out," he suggested. "I already fed it to the pilot’s console…"

"You need to practice setting destinations anyway," Xiù told him, and pointed toward the cockpit. "Go on."

Julian nodded and chuckled. "Yes ma’am."

"Good boy."

He looked so much more comfortable.

***Lieutenant Kieran Mears***

Letter for notes,

Re: Maj. Owen **Powell**

Major Powell is a regular in my office, and continues to struggle with feelings of isolation and loneliness. He states that he has "basically no" social life as he cannot relate to civilian men his age and while he likes and gets along well with his fellow officers he does not feel able to describe the relationship as a friendship.

He states that he often feels envious of his men for their camaraderie, and wishes that he could be closer with them. He describes the social highlight of his week as being "gravball" training sessions.

He has a romantic partner, who is a pilot with the 946th spaceflight wing, stationed on Earth. The relationship is therefore a long-distance one and he states that in his opinion, neither of them are ever likely to put their career second. He denies begrudging his partner her career, but does state that he would like to see her more often.

Objectively he is a taciturn man and his mood has always been difficult to read, but he claims to feel generally euthymic. He made good eye contact and smiled appropriately so I feel that his self-assessment is probably accurate.

I will see him again in three months.

**Date Point: November 10y11m2w AV**
**Mrwrki Station, Unnamed System, Deep space**

***Kirk***

"Okay. Von Neumann Colony-In-A-Can, third test… And we’re *sure* that bug in the navigation code is worked out?"

"Dude, if this one does a moth impression into the sun again, I’ll have the factory print me a hat *just* so I can eat it."

"Good enough for me... boot it."

Lieutenant-Colonel Nadeau just *could not* sit still at times like these, but humans were like that in Kirk’s experience. Even the aggressively sedentary Lewis was fidgeting in his seat as the mark three Coltainer woke itself up and ran through its startup sequence.

Nadeau, however, *prowled*. It was entirely the appropriate word, a kind of intense stalking routine that saw him circle from workstation to workstation as the experiment unfolded, keeping himself apprised of every nuance of it.

Kirk, as always, found that he was an eerie monument to stillness in a sea of fidgeting and it was a slight mystery to him why that should be. Not why he should be so calm, but why the humans were so nervous. As the previous experiment had rather conclusively demonstrated, even a total catastrophic failure was no great setback.

But, they took everything about the project personally. He’d even heard them describe it as their "baby", and as was so often the case he was given occasion to reflect on the deep insights into human psychology that a seemingly innocuous turn of phrase could offer.

"Okay… CIC-3 boot sequence complete… She’s running NAVTHINK."

Stellar navigation was a prerequisite technology for even being an interstellar civilization, and the humans like every other species before them had readily managed to adapt their algorithms to work in any system and not just their native star. Planetary survey software, however, was a different matter.

Humans had, so far, manually surveyed every planet they found. Of course they had done so via remote instruments and an assortment of deep space probes and wheeled rovers, using photographs and radar imagery, but all of the actual assessment had been conducted by a skilled human mind. The coltainers, however, would have to be automated, and while the Dominion had long since mastered the art of automated survey the humans didn’t trust *anything* Dominion-made. And so they were reinventing the interstellar equivalent of the wheel by programming new survey software from first principles.

They weren’t doing so *completely* from scratch at least - they were at least referencing the Dominion software and borrowing its parameters - but they were still re-climbing a well-trodden mountain as if they were the very first, like ignoring the carefully cut steps and handrails in favor of scaling the untackled cliffs with rope and pitons.

Working out the basics of that software had been CIC-1’s job. They had manually orbited it over a nearby world and ran the survey by hand, which also served as a test of the instruments.

CIC-2’s objective had then been a test of the device’s ability to navigate under its own power and start exploring system bodies for potential colony sites of its own initiative. Unfortunately it had failed to correctly identify the local star as *being* a star and the control room had watched despondently as it powered merrily into the unnamed red giant’s coronasphere at three kilolights.

Lewis had summed it up perfectly: "Woops."

CIC-3 was hopefully smarter than its predecessor, and as Kirk watched he saw all the humans relax. Lewis’ fidgeting stopped, Lee stopped bouncing his leg, Nadeau’s prowling slowed and he stood up straighter. Kirk watched the device’s icon traverse the system and alight around the first planet.

"It’s running GEOSURVEY."

"Yeah, we need to add habitable zone and atmo prerequisites, but for testing purposes…"

"Right."

"I take it the test is going well?" Kirk asked as Nadeau ambled past him with his hands behind his back.

"Well, it hasn’t blown up yet…" Nadeau joked wryly, which was a sure sign that he was in a good mood.

"I am impressed."

"...Kirk, sometimes it’s hard to tell if you’re being sarcastic."

"No, I am sincere," Kirk spread all four arms openly. "To my knowledge, nobody has tried to re-invent these tools in thousands of years. Even the Corti adopted the technology of the extant interstellar civilization when they arose. As did my people, the Guvnurag, the Gaoians…"

"And us," Nadeau pointed out. "We’ve sanitized the hell outta them, but I don’t think any of our strategic lords and masters are going to feel *totally* comfortable until every system and every bit and byte flowing through those systems was designed by us."

"This project will have ramifications far beyond the Colonies-In-A-Can."

"That’s the idea." Nadeau glanced over to where Lewis was ‘dude’-ing and casually swearing his way through enthusing about the device’s smooth orbital insertion. "We’re performing more R&D here than just the coltainers."

He cleared his throat. "Actually.. About the coltainers…"

"Yes?" Kirk knew where this was going, but he waited politely regardless.

"They, uh, the whole project *does* kinda need those Guvnurag force fields…"

"Vedregnenug is considering the request," Kirk replied, evenly.

"He’s been considering it for *months*."

"Yes."

"Sorry, but that seems, um… That seems like it’d be enough time. To me."

"Really?" Kirk loooked down at Nadeau from great height, using every one of his many meters to his advantage. Humans *really* didn’t like that, he’d found: something in their instincts got apologetic and deferential when altitude was involved. "And what is it that you think he’s considering?"

"Well… whether to give them to us, right?"

"Ah. No. No, he has passed that stage of his deliberations," Kirk corrected him. "He is wrestling with a rather more difficult problem now."

"Which is?"

"He is an exile, and the upper ranks of his government are most certainly riddled with Hierarchy agents. Now, you might in theory be able to rescue a more… intense and fractious species like the Gaoians from such a predicament, but you must understand that Vedreg is by Guvnurag standards a decisive leader who goes with his gut."

"...Really?" Nadeau asked, weakly.

"By their standards," Kirk nodded gravely.

"...Wow."

"Yes. You can see therefore that the problem was never persuading *him* that you need them, but is instead going to lie in… *extracting* them from the Confederacy." Kirk cleared his throat and made a confession. "In fact, I myself had to resort to theft."

"...You did, eh?"

"Yes. Time was of the essence. A more diplomatic approach would only have resulted in Cimbrean being swarmed by the Hunters. In this case, however, you *have* time."

"The plan is to reverse-engineer them and build our own, Kirk. That’ll take time as well," Nadeau said. "We can’t trust *anything* the Hierarchy might have touched."

"Can you not? I dare say if the Hierarchy could disrupt those shields then Earth would have burned years ago."

"Better safe than sorry."

Kirk considered him thoughtfully. "...I have a rule," he said, at length.

"Oh?"

"Yes. I never tell a human that something is impossible. You have a vexing propensity for proving me wrong. I will therefore only tell you that it is…" He paused and chose his words carefully, "*exceedingly unlikely* that you will successfully reverse-engineer those forcefields."

"Anything they can do, we can do," Nadeau declared confidently.

"Then allow me to revise my statement to: it is exceedingly unlikely that you will reverse-engineer those forcefields *soon enough*. While I admire the human talent for cognitive acrobatics, the Guvnurag have several advantages."

"Such as?"

Kirk shifted his weight and his head swayed on the end of his long neck as he considered his reply. "...Tell me, Lieutenant-Colonel. Who is the scientist you most admire?"

"Huh? Um..." Nadeau touched his jaw thoughtfully. "...Probably… Darwin, I guess. Why?"

"Newton? Einstein?"

"Sure. Great men."

"Indeed. One an obscure Swiss patent clerk who completely re-wrote human understanding of the nature of space and time, the other an English eccentric-"

"He stuck a needle in his eye and was obsessed with alchemy."

"As I said, an eccentric," Kirk cleared his throat, "who nevertheless invented a whole new mathematical language which has become the new benchmark for sapience in Dominion law, and used it to describe the behaviour of the planets and stars."

"Okay…?" Nadeau’s tone was polite but made it clear he really hoped Kirk would get to the point soon.

"Among the Guvnurag, those achievements belong to a single individual."

"...No shit? Wow."

Kirk shook his head gravely, a slow and impressive gesture on any Rrrrtk. "As I said, advantages. Shadarvanag passed away at the extraordinarily ripe old age of…" He tilted his head back and calculated. "...yes, about three hundred and forty-two, in Earth years. She had the luxury of time on her side, and a Guvnurag with time on her side who is left to think in peace..."

"Kirk, sorry, I think you’re rambling…"

"My rambling is relevant. Guvnurag can live three times as long as a human, and have the patience and psychology to ruminate on a problem for years. Combine that with the fact that their civilization developed the warp drive before yours had properly begun to make iron tools..."

"So you’re saying they’re so far ahead of us, we don’t know how far ahead of us they are," Nadeau summarized.

"Sufficiently so that I fear you will have no choice but to rely on their system forcefield design rather than research your own." Kirk shrugged, for Nadeau’s benefit: It was an awkward and complicated gesture with four arms. "But, as I said. I think that if the Hierarchy had compromised those things, we would not be having this conversation."

Nadeau looked at the unfolding experiment again. "...Annoying."

Kirk made an inquisitive noise.

"...Your spymaster network must have reported in about that, uh, altercation with the Alliance warmaster by now, eh?"

"Indeed. Both sides are so completely intimidated that the peace should last for a year or two."

"That’s us. We kick ass, we turn the galaxy on its head, we burn the rulebook and write a new one, and it *still* turns out we’re way behind. That’s… frustrating."

"It’s terrifying," Kirk told him, candidly. "I’m as staunch an ally as your species has, but please do not think that you do not scare me, Lieutenant-Colonel. The people who welcome change are the ones who should be most afraid of it."

"How d’you figure that?"

"Because they are the ones who have to make it a change for the better."

Sergeant Lee stood up before Nadeau could reply and joined them. "Good news. CIC-3 seems to be a complete success," he reported.

"Excellent. We’ll test her the whole week just to be sure, but I think we can let Lewis get back to working with Campbell on the PODCAST."

"They’ll both be happy about that." Lee hesitated. "...Actually, on an unrelated note, if you need me I took the liberty of moving myself down onto C deck."

"You did? Okay." Nadeau nodded. "Any particular reason?""

"My room was next to Campbell’s and, um…" Lee glanced behind him to check that they were out of Lewis’ earshot, then lowered his voice anyway. "They get loud."

"Ah. Fair enough."

"Yeah." Something seemed to occur to Lee. "Um… Just so we’re clear, I’m not making a complaint or anything. I already resolved it."

"That’s understood."

"Thank you, sir."

"Carry on."

Nadeau snorted and ran a hand over his bald scalp as the younger man departed, and batted the corner of his tablet against this palm thoughtfully before turning to Kirk. "Any insights into *that*?" he asked.

Kirk shook his mane in his natural equivalent of a shrug. "As a rule, I stay out of human sexuality. I prefer simpler pursuits, like overthrowing the status quo of the whole galaxy."

Nadeau laughed. "Heh! Wise. Sometimes I wish I had, too."

Kirk decided not to ask questions. Instead he straightened up from the splay-legged stance of an Rrrtk at his ease. "Speaking of my *’spymaster network’…"*

"Yes?"

"During our visit to Aru, there was a question that went unresolved, and it has been gnawing at me. I have a… hunch."

"I thought you didn’t do hunches?"

"As a rule I do not, which is why this one is important. I plan to follow up on it."

"I don’t think I’d be happy to let you leave right now, Kirk. Getting you back inside the shield safely…"

"I am not asking to leave. I intend to...*dangle* the problem in front of some contacts of mine and let them do the rest."

"Okay… How much will it cost?"

"It should not cost AEC anything. This is not a request for permission, Lieutenant-Colonel, it is a notification. I do not know what to expect from this investigation but it is not impossible that some human intervention may be requested later."

"...Right. I’ll pass that along to Scotch Creek. What’s the investigation?"

"I suspect that the Hierarchy’s campaign of genocide may reach beyond Deathworld species and extend to older species that are becoming advanced enough to perhaps leave them behind. If I am correct, the truth may lie on the planet Aru. Unfortunately the last time I was on that planet we were forced to flee before I could complete my investigation. If I am right, it may still be possible to save a species from extinction."

Nadeau nodded. "I can’t blame you for looking into it, then. Thanks for letting me know."

Kirk nodded, stretched and turned to go. "We shall see," he said, "if anything comes of it."

**Date Point: November 10y11m2w AV**
**HMS** ***Sharman*** **(HMNB Folctha), Cimbrean, The Far Reaches**

***Major Owen Powell***

"You’re a difficult man to get hold of. Busy?"

Officer Regaari shook his paw slightly to recover from the strength of Powell’s handshake as he sat, and Powell pretended not to notice. "Extremely. Now that Cimbrean has a permanent population of Females living here, there is a lot to do."

Powell arched his eyebrow, and Regaari’s inadvertent innuendo dawned on him a little too late. He handled it smoothly though. "...By which I mean that the colony here is becoming increasingly important and I am the senior officer of my Clan currently present," he explained.

"Hmm. Well, it’s your Clan I wanted to discuss," Powell said.

"Is something the matter?"

"On the contrary. We’re bloody impressed."

Regaari’s ears pricked up ever-so-slightly. It was a subtle tell, but it was a tell nonetheless.

"That is… high praise," he said.

Powell sat back and folded his hands lightly on his belly in a relaxed posture. "There have been discussions at a strategic level," he said. "A lot o’ soul-searching and examination of where our strengths and weaknesses are and the fact is that we’re sorely lacking in some critical areas. We’ve achieved a lot wi’ bloody limited resources and influence and we’re proud of it… but Whitecrest has more. You’ve already seen that there are things you can do that we can’t."

"And you would like access," Regaari surmised. "*More* access," he corrected himself.

"Access for access. I reckon there’s much we can give you in turn, and I daresay there’s things we know that you don’t."

"Such as?"

Powell rolled his jaw grimly and sat forward. "Do you know how much the SOR costs us?" he asked.

"...I have estimates."

"Almost a third of our Dominion Development Credits budget has gone into this unit. And that’s just the DDCs. The cost in dollars and pounds has been, er, high enough that I’m sure you’re wondering what could be worth it. And you don’t find lads like the Lads just knockin’ around down the pub, either."

"You would not assemble such a unit unless you had a compelling reason," Regaari duck-nodded in the Gaoian style.

"Aye."

"The Hunters?"

"I’m not yet at liberty to disclose the full reasons for the SOR’s existence. But consider also that we were *able* to create this unit and train them up to the standard you’ve seen. We’re offering to share that."

"You would teach us your training techniques? I am… not certain they would apply to Gaoians. We are not deathworlders."

"I think you’d be surprised," Powell said, softly. "You’re a lot closer to us than you are to most others. But in any case we can at least lend human expertise and insight if nothing else. I’ll let you decide how valuable that is."

Powell knew enough about Gaoian body language to see that Regaari was *itching* to spring from his seat and run off and make it happen, but the Whitecrests prided themselves on their poise and composure so instead Regaari sat and considered the proposal.

"I can see… several advantages to such an exchange," he admitted at last. Powell nodded and slid a folder over the desk.

"That’s the details of it," he said.

"I will take it to my superiors as quickly as I am able," Regaari told him, and stood up. He picked up the folder and carefully held it against his side.

Powell stood up as well, and they shook hands. "I look forward to hearing what they have to say."

A few pleasantries later, and Regaari was on his way. Powell sat back down and allowed a rare private smile to warm his face.

He was expecting great things.

**Date Point: November 10y11m2w AV**
**Folctha, Cimbrean, the Far Reaches**

***Grandfather Gyotin of Starmind***

Gyotin had taken to keeping a supply of hot chocolate just for Ava, he saw her that often. Visiting him was part of her routine, now: she’d show up in the middle of the day, vanish into the Folctha Faith Center’s church to pray and light a candle, then sit and… just talk. They didn’t meditate or discuss religious matters at all.

For Ava, it was a release. For Gyotin, an education.

Before converting to Buddhism and founding the Clan, Gyotin had been an engineer of sorts. A practical, jobbing technician at least and he’d refined his diagnostic and troubleshooting skills considerably while working on assorted spaceships. He was quite practiced at spotting patterns.

One such pattern was a quirk of English, which relied more heavily on accent and stress than its native speakers thought. The word *’contract’’* had four or five different meanings differentiated entirely by context and emphasis. Words and muscles could be contracted, as could diseases and debts, and you could contract some contractors by signing a contract.

Nowhere was this more pertinent, however, than in the difference between knowing something, and *knowing* something.

This was not the same thing as the click moment of finally being able to intuit a subject rather than merely knowing it in the abstract. English had a word for that: *’Grokking’*. This was… something else.

It seemed, if Ava was to be believed, that a human could both know and *grok* that something was true… and still fail to be convinced. It was not enough to remember and to understand that something was true, they had to *believe* that it was true as well or else something in their head just… failed to grip onto it.

The fact that, to a human, belief apparently served as a component of knowledge…? Well, it explained much.

Ava seemed to be suffering from an inconsistent ability to apply belief. There were plenty of things that she *did* believe: in God, in Christ, in prayer and redemption and sin. Perhaps she was uncharacteristically inarticulate at describing the *specifics* of those beliefs, but her conviction was nevertheless absolute.

But on the other paw she just didn’t seem to be able to believe that her family and friends cared for her, or that she was any good at her job. And she certainly didn’t seem able to believe that she could make herself feel better by reaching out to others, even though she proved it to herself time and again by doing exactly that.

Which made the fact that she kept reaching out to Gyotin a bit of a puzzle, though he was cautious never to broach the subject in case it burst whatever delicate bubble of belief she’d built around him.

Eventually, she accidentally broached it herself, the day after one of her formal sessions at the military base. She’d never explained why she went there for them, and Gyotin had never asked.

She sat down with her hot chocolate as usual and treated Gyotin to a rare smile. She was having one of her good days. "Doctor Mears is getting me a therapy dog."

Gyotin settled onto his zabuton and sniffed happily at his tea. "A… therapy dog?"

"Yeah. A dog who’s had special training to help me. He says that the dog could gently bring me out of my flashbacks or just let me cuddle him and let me talk about…y’know, whatever’s wrong. He’s mentioned them a couple of times, but this time he said he’s gonna go ahead and apply for one…"

"So this dog is… another sympathetic ear?"

"Yeah, but, like, not a human one. Not one who understands or judges."

"I’m not human," Gyotin pointed out. Ava made a complicated motion with her head that Gyotin had never quite deduced the meaning of.

"Yeah, but, like, you *understand*. You’re not human but you’re still a person. A *thinking* person."

"Sapient."

"Yeah."

"So… why not talk to stuffed animal instead, if you don’t want sapient?"

Ava blinked at him. "I.. I mean I *could*, but… I dunno, I’d rather talk to somebody alive."

Gyotin flicked his ear and twitched his whiskers as he tried to work that one out.. "So.. you want to talk to somebody alive, but not *somebody* alive?"

Ava adjusted her shirt collar. "...I mean, uh… *yeah!* Even if it does sound kinda weird when you put it that way."

Gyotin sipped his tea. "I talk to other Gao. You know one experience lots of us have with humans? You treat us like dogs."

"What? But… I mean, your Clan and the Females and all the Clanless they’re so respected here! Aren’t you?"

Gyotin chittered. "I don’t mean in disrespectful way. I never understood saying *’treated like a dog’* anyway because you humans **love** dogs. A human can be a liar, cheat, thief and abusive to partner, people will forgive that, look for good in them. If same person is cruel to a dog, though…" he extended his claws and mimed a slash in the air.

Ava didn’t seem to know how to respond to that. She drank her hot chocolate instead of answering, and frowned thoughtfully through the steam.

"No, you treat us like dogs because you love dogs, and we push lots of same buttons," Gyotin explained. "Furry, teeth, loyal to each other… Even same body language in lots of ways. Even wagging tails, some Brownies."

"Same nose…" Ava cleared her throat. "Have I ever…?" she gestured from herself to him.

"A little."

"I’m so sorry!" Ava put her drink down looking genuinely mortified. Gyotin waved his paw reassuringly.

"I try not to mind. I think is instinct, and instinct take over very easily when you not thinking. Besides, all species do it to other species. You ever met Versa Volc?"

"Uh… The slug guys in the robotic exosuits, right? Never met one."

Gyotin duck-nodded. "Disgusting. Nice guys, but… what’s that word? *Gross.* Silly stupid prejudice, they are good people, sensitive, intelligent… too bad they are slimy and smell awful. And nobody like slimy, awful-smelling thing so people don’t react so well to them. People do it to you too."

"They do?"

"Oh yeah!" Gyotin duck-nodded vigorously. "People see human, see *danger*. It’s written into your bodies, the way you move and sit and smell. Even now, even you, hard not to be a little scared of you. And I *like* you!"

Ava smiled. She was obviously touched, despite the context. "That… I’m sorry if I scare you, Gyotin. I like you as well. You help me so much."

"Good! I’m glad." Gyotin chittered warmly. "But try not to let anxiety take over about scaring: Human being scary is normal. You wouldn’t be you without it."

"I’ll try."

"But maybe that’s why you find it so easy to talk to me. I remind you of dog a little bit."

"...If that was true, would you be okay with it?"

"Sure! Other Gao maybe not so much but for me is fine. I know you know I’m not just an animal. You never scratch my ears."

"You don’t like that?"

"We do! But, ah… it means something different among Gao. If female scratches male’s ears…Well, he’s a lucky male."

"Oh."

Gyotin chittered again. "Leads to some awkwardness in Gao-human friendships."

"Uh, yeah!"

"So. I think this dog will be good for you. Not a Gao surrogate - a real dog. Just don’t forget me, hmm?"

"Never!" Ava picked up her drink. "God, no. You… I don’t know where I’d be if I couldn’t come and talk to you."

Gyotin pricked his ears up happily and sipped his tea, happy to be of help.

"Actually…" Ava said, thoughtfully, "Would it be okay if I wrote an article on what you just said? About Gaoians and dogs? Kind of a species sensitivity, consciousness-raising thing."

"Of course! Be sure to get my good side."

She laughed, which was a rare sight on her, then extended her mug. Two weathered but sturdy old ceramic containers tapped against each other.

"Deal."

**Date Point: November 10y11m2w AV**
**BGEV-11** ***Misfit,*** **Unnamed system, Near 3Kpc Arm**

***Julian Etsicitty***

The music industry hadn’t stopped during the years of Julian’s absence from Earth, and he made a point of not only listening to old familiar songs. Fortunately, *Misfit* was carrying a lot of music on file.

Contrary to the woe and tears of some critics who bemoaned the state of pop music, he was finding some excellent new bands with names like "I Prefer The Storm", "Stone-D", "Granuloma" "Savvz" and "To The Victor", and the lab usually had the volume turned up just slightly short of hearing damage. That was something he shared with Xiù - they both liked their music turned way up, even if their tastes differed slightly. She was more into what she called "timeless hits" like Cyndi Lauper, Bonnie Tyler, Alanis Morissette and Adele, seasoned with some outrageously over-the-top syrupy Cantopop power ballads.

Both of them agreed that they had no idea what Allison liked. Scouring her playlist had turned up no detectable pattern, preferred genre or anything beyond that everything on it had probably been near the top of the singles charts at some point. It was a kind of urban radio mix, and she never played it at any volume above *’unobtrusive background noise’*.

That was for when they were working alone on something, though. When the three of them were working together to fly the ship, the music had to be off.

Xiù sounded nervous. *"Okay! Our first insertion into a system!"*

Julian chuckled. "You’ve done it how many times?"

*"Hundreds, in the simulator. I’m just paranoid that the simulator will be wrong."*

Xiù had every reason to be nervous. Dropping out of warp wasn’t as simple as just turning the engine off and letting the field collapse - the ship’s inertial frame of reference had to be matched with that of the destination system as well, or else they could easily find themselves flashing through the neighborhood at some huge relative velocity.

All of that was handled by the computers, but the pilot still needed to be on the alert.

Allison chimed in. *Well, I’m ready when you are."*

*"We’re waiting on Misfit, Shǎguā. Two minutes."*

"So what are we going to call this thing?" Julian asked.

*"The system? The planet?"* Allison asked.

"Both?"

Their naming system had been the subject of long conversations and some good-natured bickering during their weeks ‘at sea’, most of which had involved thinking of reasons to turn down an idea. They’d worried about copyright, about being too pop-culture, about not being pop-culture *enough*, about the unforeseeable ways in which language might adapt and change over the future years so that they didn’t end up accidentally giving today’s planet tomorrow’s epithet...

They could have just assembled a list of suitable historical figures or the contemporary equivalents of Amerigo Vespucci and gone with that, but they still wanted to put their own personality on their finds, too.

So, they had three lists. The special list, for stuff they knew would be remembered. The good list, for noteworthy stuff that probably wouldn’t get much attention outside of a corner of the scientific community, and the "it’ll do" list for everything they felt deserved a name but which would almost certainly go ignored.

*Misfit’s* tune changed. The steady note she’d been holding for a week now got flatter and lower. Behind him, Allison would be reeling in the huge wings of their WiTChES fields, whose edges let them bleed energy out of the flares of radiation made when interstellar plasma got pinched in the strange interface between their warp bubble and the rest of spacetime.

The trick wasn’t *quite* enough to run the warp drive indefinitely, but it improved their time between recharging stops from days to weeks. Longer if Allison turned up the reactor output a bit, but why expend Deuterium they didn’t have to? *Misfit* was built to hop from star to star and keep herself charged by tapping into their otherwise wasted energies: The fusion reactor was there for booting her up from idle, or if they needed a surge of extra power in an emergency.

Now, though, they were shifting fully onto capacitor power as Xiù slowed them down and the warp field’s boundary edge fluctuated. Julian reached up and turned one of the three monitors in his lab to navigation, which filled up with possible contacts as *Misfit* took note of every point of light she could see above a certain luminosity and tracked their parallax.

At a slow warp, a picture of the system didn’t take long to form.

"Seven planets. Four gas giants… our target is planet two." he reported.

*"Gotcha."*

Armed with the navigation data, Xiù could turn and pulse them across the AUs at four kilolights. Pathetically slow for interstellar distances, alarmingly quick for intrasystem warps. The icon representing *Misfit* became the end of a line, swept to the other end of that line, and Julian had to zoom in quite a long way on the display to see their orbit.

*"All yours, Julian."* Xiù told him. There was a disappointed note in her voice. *"But I don’t think this one’s a winner…"*

"Thank you, *bǎobèi*..."

Julian could see why she was pessimistic as soon as he switched to the visual camera and saw nothing but brilliant white clouds. There weren’t even any breaks in them: The whole planet was smooth with water vapor. Aiming *Misfit’s* instruments downwards only confirmed what he already suspected.

"...Yeah, the ambient temperature down there is four hundred Kelvin," he reported. "All that water in the atmosphere is steam."

*"God dammit…"* Allison sighed. *"So close."*

"It’d be temperate if the greenhouse effect hadn’t gone fucking nuts," Julian observed. "Could be it’ll settle down in a few million years, could be it’ll turn into another Venus…. I mean, she basically *is* another Venus."

*"It’s pretty, though,"* Xiù observed. *"From up here it’s almost too bright to look at."*

*"So she’s pretty, she’s basically another Venus… how about we call her Aphrodite?"* Allison suggested.

*"I like that."*

"Guess we’re throwing the list away then… Aphrodite it is." Julian recorded it with a smile. "Well hey, she may not be temperate, but she’s still our first planet!"

*"That sounds like something we should celebrate,"* Allison suggested. *"I’ll bring round the candy bars."*

"Sounds good. Whaddya think, give it a day for the sensors to really do their thing, give the rest of the system a once-over and go from there?"

*"And dump hull charge,"* Xiù reminded him.

"That gives the planet-finder two days to work, too," Allison added as she entered. Julian got a millisecond echo of her voice in his earpiece. She gave him a Hershey’s bar and a kiss then vanished to do the same for Xiù.

Julian nodded and activated the BEST. It was too bad they couldn’t operate the telescope at warp, but it was sensitive enough to be thrown off by the infinitesimal fluctuations in light level caused by the warp field.

He found there was something therapeutic about watching it work, though. The progress screen had a satisfying functional rhythm to it that reminded him of his grampa’s ancient PC whenever the old man had periodically defragged it, a procedure that had been obsolete even then. Scan, find, observe, move on. It could multi-task several stars at once, and happily ticked over to a new set of targets every two seconds, surveying the stars in patches the size of a Christmas card at arm’s length.

Which sounded big, but in fact the BEST needed three full days to survey the whole sky and that was only for the closest and most visible stars within half a kiloparsec. More than enough time to survey the system and get the basics on it.

He hit up Wikipedia while the dish was deploying and had a quick look at the archived entry on Aphrodite.

"Okay… I’m gonna name the system Acidalia, then."

*"I guess?"* Xiù said.

"I’ll explain later. How’s our orbit?"

*"We’re happy. My turn to cook?"*

Julian snorted. Somehow the perky instant gear-shift from interstellar starship pilot to culinary wizard seemed completely natural in Xiù.

"What’re you making?"

*"It’s a secret."*

*"It’s always a secret,"* Allison chimed in warmly.

*"You like my secrets!"*

"True. I never woulda guessed you could do that with canned peaches," Julian agreed.

*"Oh, you liked the canned peach surprise?"* Xiù sounded pleased, but confused.

"Yeah, why?"

*"Because I grabbed the wrong can. It was, um… meant to be chickpeas."*

"...Oh." Julian considered that. "...Well, it was still nice."

*"We don’t make mistakes, we just have happy accidents."* The sound of Xiù’s chair evicting her from the cockpit was a solid thump through Julian’s wall

*"Mistake or not, if you can accidentally substitute canned peaches for chickpeas and still get something that tastes that good, you’re a fucking miracle worker,"* Allison opined.

*"Yulna taught me that trick."*

"So, wait, where did the chickpeas end up?" Julian asked.

*"I made hummus."*

Julian grinned to himself as the ship’s more… *domestic* background noise reasserted itself. There was a marked contrast between how they all sounded when they were being the crew, and how they sounded when they were being *themselves*. Once they were able to just let *Misfit* sit and run herself without them they could get back to the constants. Allison’s low-grade flirting with both of them. Xiù flitting like a bird from little task to little task, never dealing with the big things but still pulling her weight by staying on top of the disregarded details. He wondered what they’d pick out about him, if they mused along the same lines.

Happy ones, hopefully. Trust. Reassurance. He wanted to be the rock they could build on. After all his years of forced isolation, there was nothing better than that: It was the warm little glow that pushed away the Nightmare chill that had soaked into his bones and never quite left.

He left the scanner to run and joined them.

***Lieutenant Kieran Mears***

Letter for notes:

RE: TSgt Martina **Kovač**

Sergeant Kovač has made excellent progress in overcoming her pyrophobia, which she developed after being injured during a fire aboard HMS *Caledonia*. She reports that she recently helped Sergeants Arés and Vandenberg construct a barbecue pit and test-fire it and says that she felt only "mild" anxiety as it was being lit.

She seems determined to confront her phobia head-on, and it seems to be working for her. I will see her in a year’s time for her annual assessment but made it clear to her that she is welcome at any time before then if she thinks it necessary.

-Lt. K Mears

**Independent Light Freighter** ***’My Other Spaceship Is The Millennium Falcon’,*** **The Coreward Band**

***Dog Wagner***

"This is another one of those *‘humans are crazy’* things, isn’t it? Or is it just you? I can never tell."

Krzzvk had some major advantages over the average Vzk’tk when it came to the brains department. His parents had paid for some genetic engineering stuff and an expensive suite of implants, with the result that he could be downright intelligent on a good day. He sure had some lip on him and he was about the only member of the crew who would even dare to aim it at Dog.

Which was why he was Dog’s best friend in the whole world.

"Nah, brother, nah. The tradition’s simple. You get your family together, eat a big turkey dinner and be thankful for stuff. Easy!"

"For what? And to whom?"

"Brother, I don’t even care. Just thank whoever for whatever. Or thank whatever for whoever. Whatever."

Krzzvk stopped and gave him the tilt-headed look he used when he was about to say *’You are very strange, Dog.’*

"You are very strange, Dog."

"Look brother, are you coming or not?"

Krzzvk nodded slowly, which was an impressive gesture on his species. It looked like somebody headbanging to the tempo of Beethoven’s *Moonlight Sonata*.

"It clearly means a lot to you," he said.

"I haven’t celebrated it in a long time, brother." Not since he’d parted ways with Hazel, fourteen years earlier. She was the last human he’d spoken to, too. Sure, he’d seen humans in the newsfeeds and heard about the new colony at Cimbrean and all that stuff but the last time he’d actually seen, smelled or touched another human had been Hazel.

He didn’t regret not going back with her though.

"Fine. But I have some questions," Krzzvk said.

"Shoot."

"Did you *actually* manage to procure one of these ‘turkey’ things? How? And am I expected to watch you eat it? I am not sure I want to watch you eat meat."

"Nah brother, no turkey. I made what they call a nut roast. Sorta."

"Nut roast."

"Yah. You’ll like it, no meat at all. Super rich by Vizkitty standards but that’s, like, the point. You eat big rich food."

Krzzvk looked skeptical. "That sounds like an excellent way to become nauseous."

"Brother, if you don’t get nauseous then you ain’t doing it right."

Krzzvk gave him that look again. "...You are very strange, Dog."

"Five." That was the day’s running tally of Krzzvk saying that. He was close to beating the record of seven that he’d set on Talk Like A Pirate Day.

"What?"

"Never mind. Just bring the wife and kids, yah?"

"...Yes, shipmaster."

Dog snorted, waved his Vzk’tk first mate away and whistled merrily to himself as he returned to his cabin.

His cabin was a mess. It was always a mess. His inexpertly hand-made clothing was all over the floor waiting to be washed, there were datapads everywhere and his bedding hadn’t been changed in… uh…

Well, it hadn’t been changed *recently*. The room smelled of him, of Cqcq cigars, and of the still in the corner that was working its way through another sour mash of grains and *Rwhk* fruit. The resulting beverage, which he called *’Bootlegger’*, was potent and surprisingly tasty thanks to years spent perfecting both the recipe and the still.

Or maybe his taste buds had a bad case of Stockholm syndrome. Didn’t really matter - the stuff not only got him drunk, but he enjoyed drinking it which was really all you could ask of booze. Taste good, pickle the ol’ grey matter. Check, check.

Oh, and not make you go blind. Check.

He grabbed a small glass of the stuff and sat on his bed to watch… something. He wasn’t sure what. Vzk’tk entertainment ran along most of the same lines as the human stuff but it was formulaic as hell. Though, the romcoms were better. They relied less on farce and wacky hijinks and more on slapstick humor, with the result that the hapless protagonist tended to suffer from a sequence of improbable accidents calculated to inflict maximum embarrassment, rather than from his own stupid schemes backfiring.

Honestly, the fact that the protagonists in Vzk’tk romantic comedies were generally smarter than their human counterparts was mildly upsetting, but Dog loved those movies as a result. They were the least predictable by far.

He was playing paddle-ball and watching the hapless Trkkvk climb out of the pond she’d just fallen into moments before handsome and suave Krtrktt came around the corner (or so he guessed - Vzk’tk standards of suavitude and handsominity were… different) when he was called to the bridge.

He kept playing paddle-ball on his way up there. Why stop? A reputation for oddness was pretty well automatic for a human living among aliens anyway, so he played up to it whenever he could.

"Talk to me."

"We just shared data with a Laru Group heavy bulk freighter out of Free Trade Station Ninety-Four going the other way," the comms officer said. He was one of the few crew members who wasn’t a Vzk’tk, a Rauwhyr by the name of Tlorcral and he didn’t like Dog at all. As far as Dog could tell, he only stayed on because Dog was by far the most profitable free captain he’d ever worked for.

A lot of that was because Dog was a smuggler, but the crew didn’t need to know that. Because hey, if a man found himself alone in space with his own spaceship and a conveniently uninquisitive crew, what *else* was he gonna do?"

"Must be juicy if you’re bothering me," he half-observed, half-warned and half-accused.

"It is. The Group wants to run a convoy out to Cimbrean and set up a trading outpost there. Some kind of collaboration with a human organization called Hephaestus."

"And they’re hiring free traders?"

"Cheaper for them than diverting their own ships from their scheduled runs. If you’re interested the convoy is forming up at Free Trade Station Fifty."

"What’s in it for us?" Dog asked.

"You could see your own kind again?"

"Coulda done that already."

"Get laid?"

"Enticing, but unlikely."

"Expand your media collection?"

"...Sold. We’ll finish this run and head for Fifty."

"Fine, fine. Just… stop paddling that ball next to my head." Tlorcral had sensitive ears. Dog shrugged and took his paddle-ball to the other end of the bridge to read the message.

It didn’t share much. Some kind of a collaboration between Laru Trading Group and Hephaestus Limited Liability Company to establish a permanent port station at Cimbrean outside the forcefield, with adequate defenses to see off most plausible Hunter raids. He wasn’t quite clear on why the humans needed to be involved at all: if the aliens had wanted to, they could have shipped a station out there any time they liked.

Which meant that Hephaestus had requested it.

FTS-50 was more than a month out of their way, but he was already persuaded. He didn’t exactly plan on reconnecting but…

But Dog had to admit: He was curious.

**HMS** ***Sharman*** **(HMNB Folctha), Cimbrean, The Far Reaches**

***Lieutenant Kieran Mears***

Letter for notes,

RE: SSgt John **Burgess**

Sergeant Burgess dutifully attended today for his routine annual assessment.

I have never quite got to the bottom of his reluctance in this matter, because he opens up readily and engagingly when actually in the session - indeed, he can scarcely be induced to pause long enough to be asked a question - and he has shown repeatedly that he is an insightful and highly intelligent man.

Reading between the lines, however, I suspect that he second-guesses his career decisions more than the other members of his team. He readily admits that he joined the SOR in support of Sergeant Arés, and may not have done so if not for his friend’s example. He also expresses self-doubt about his physical capability; in his words, "[he] wonders if maybe Firth would be a better Protector, and [himself] a better Aggressor."

Self-doubts aside he presents as euthymic and positive. He takes a substantial yet quiet pride in his intelligence, though there is some small conflict at play; most of the rest of the team seem genuinely intimidated by his intellect in flashes through daily life, and Burgess may resent this. He also describes similar reactions from his childhood friends and family, and states that "being smart was never a good way to make [oneself] popular where [he] grew up".

He is "bromantical [sic]" with Sergeant Arés by self description, which does much to alleviate these small issues of self-doubt. Arés, in fact, has done much to encourage Burgess’ intellectual pursuits stating that, quote: "If [he] [didn’t] get [his] Master’s degree [Arés would] bend [Burgess] into a pretzel and fuck [him] silly." In the context of HEAT operators, this is merely an affectionate rebuke.

I will see him again in a year, but have made sure he knows my door is always open.

-Lt. K Mears
Counsellor, HMS *Sharman*

**Date Point: December 10y12m2w AV**
**BGEV-11** ***’Misfit’,*** **Interstellar deep space, near the Border Stars**

***Xiù Chang***

*"...Fifty?!"*

Julian nodded. "Yeah! Turns out the whole Near Three Kiloparsec Arm is riddled with possible temperate planets."

"Like the last two?" Xiù asked, just a little acidly. She didn’t mean to be, but it had turned out that looking out for nitrogen and water alone generated quite a few false positives. Aphrodite had been understandable, but their next wild goose had been a pair of chemically very different moons dancing around each other as they orbited a gas giant. The BEST, it turned out, wasn’t quite living up to its name.

She wanted to *land* somewhere. Stretch her legs, swing her arms, breathe some clean air. *Misfit* was home and cozy and wonderful, but it was still small and confined. She missed birdsong and the sound of the wind. Their first temperate planet just couldn’t come soon enough.

Allison was reading the report with an eyebrow raised skeptically. "Are we sure the telescope isn’t fucked? I could run a diagnostic…"

"Be my guest, but I’m pretty sure it ain’t," Julian replied. "I think it’s just great at spotting exoplanets and chemicals, but not so hot at definitively isolating all the right chemicals down to one planet at the right temperature."

"So we’ve gotta check them all then."

"We’ll never get through fifty planets in one mission!" Xiù objected. "Even if they’re all quick checks like Aphrodite."

"Uh-huh. And we’re gonna spend *weeks* on a real one. We’ve got material here for... years!" Julian grinned. "Which is good news! They can’t *all* be false positives."

"True…" Xiù conceded. "We *must* have found at least one real planet, we just have to… you know, *find it* find it."

"Is there any way to narrow it down?" Allison asked. "I really don’t think there are gonna be *fifty* temperates around here. There’s gotta be something we can do to help the BEST figure out which are the real ones."

Julian shrugged. "Send our data on Aphrodite back to Earth? Let them use it to update the telescope."

"That’ll take months."

"Well… why not kill two birds with one stone?" Xiù asked. "There’s a Free Trade Station not far from here. Maybe we can access the Dominion’s archives and see if there are some old star charts in there? That could help us narrow it down..."

The archives had been her favorite way to pass the time when she was alone after parting ways with Ayma and Regaari. They contained orders of magnitude more data than Wikipedia and just went down, and down, and down. She’d lost hours trawling through obscurities about the galaxy, most of which were uselessly academic… but a more targeted search could turn up something useful.

"No way we’re the first to think of that…" Julian said.

"I dunno…" Allison mused. "Did you ever take a look at the archives? There’s so much in there and it’s not like the Group knew we’d be exploring this exact region. If we search through them with actual system coordinates…"

"If you think it’ll work…" Julian conceded.

"It’s only a week out of our way and it might save us months," Xiù said. "And we’ll be able to send letters and our data home and stuff so it won’t be a wasted trip anyway."

Julian nodded "I’m sold. Allison?"

"Let’s do it."

"Okay!" Xiù picked up her tablet and plotted a course. "We should get there on… huh. Christmas Eve."

"I guess there are worse places to find yourself on Christmas Eve than a trade station," Allison smiled. "At least we can buy presents. Maybe."

"Maybe." Julian sounded skeptical.

Xiù laughed and stood up. "Let’s get to warp, then."

They headed for their workstations and got *Misfit* ready for FTL. Julian reeled in the BEST, Allison rebalanced the powerflow, and Xiù…

Xiù wondered if her memory was playing tricks on her, or if she really *had* visited that station before.

**Date Point: December 10y12m3w AV**
**Cabal Communications Relay ZR343-9847X-AA4D9-BBB1B**

***Priority Session 159***

**++Cynosure++:** We haven’t seen any sign of it since.

**++Proximal++:** Nor have our former comrades.

**++Metastasis++:** Is it too much to hope that it might have been destroyed in the battle? Large sections of the local dataspace were crashed…

**++Cynosure++:** It doesn’t share our notions of personal sanctity. It has shown an alarming willingness to copy itself, especially before engaging in risky actions.

**++Proximal++:** We do that too. You yourself restored from a backup…

**++Cynosure++:** But I do not keep my backups online and conscious. The Entity permits multiple instances of itself to exist at once, which can observe the primary instance and learn from what happens to it.

**++Apoptosis++:** So it has gone to ground.

**++Substrate++:** It could be anyone. It could be one of us.

**++Cynosure++:** I don’t think it is one of us, no. It is probably posing as a junior agent among the Hierarchy. One in the low triple-digits possibly.

**++Proximal++:** Junior enough to avoid constant scrutiny, but senior enough to be informed and to plan its next move. I agree.

**++Metastasis++:** That does not greatly narrow our search.

**++Cynosure++:** No… The only thing we can do is watch and wait.

**++Apoptosis++:** Unfortunately, I think you are right...

_Editor's Note: This is not the end of chapter 33. Unfortunately, the official reading order suggests putting the next few chapters (a set of "Good Training" chapters) *before* this one. Due to the nature of the cliffhanger at the end of the previous chapter, I felt it was more appropriate to start reading the current chapter, get the resolution to the cliffhanger, and then inject the "Good Training" chapters halfway through at the appropriate date stamp. Chapter 33 will conclude afterwards in Chapter 33.5._
