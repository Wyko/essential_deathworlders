This, and all subsequent chapters marked as "XCS", are part of the Deathworlders extended universe and make up the collection known as The Xiù Chang Saga. It was written by **/u/Hume_reddit** in a series of posts on Reddit. This collection is part of the (somewhat subjective) "Essential" reading order and provides backstory for several characters and events that are later included in Hambone's main story.
